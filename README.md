**I've kinda abandoned this Github account in favour of my new account [@nicoleaoki](https://github.com/nicoleaoki), aside from personal projects and things that I'm really proud of, this account will go to sleep for a while until I get the motivation to start working on more "public" things.**

**Also find me on [Gitgud](https://gitgud.io/@kris), where I continue to develop things under the Kritterhouse name.**
