# hey!

i'm leila. but you've probably known me as kris or nicole in the past.

i'm not good at explaining who i am. but i have a website that might be of help for that over at [leila.moe](https://leila.moe).

most of the time i do things over [@runway23](https://github.com/runway23), a low-profit cooperative i founded alongside some friends to aid open source projects, but that's my work stuff or something.

that's all i guess, thank you for stopping by.
